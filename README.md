# MusicPlayer

## Introduce

A music player made just for studying Android.

I made it just for studying **Service**, **Broadcast Receiver** and **Content Provider**.

The most difficult period is that designing algorithm to synchronize lyric. It took me much time.

And in this project I did some practice about calling third-party API.
